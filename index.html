            <p>
              It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea,
              located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat
              and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain
              range.
            </p>

            <p>
              Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important
              cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly
              renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís
              Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World
              Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious
              universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu
              Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the
              Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for
              hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class
              conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport
              tournaments have been played here.

              Hi! My name is Irina and Barcelona is my favorite city. I've been
              there only once but I'm absolutely in love with that place. I
              created this page as part of a project for SheCodes responsive to
              develop my coding skills.
